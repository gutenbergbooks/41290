<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The two pieces here reproduced have long been unavailable; their
connections with Arbuthnot are rather complex. <i>The Story of the St.
Alb-ns Ghost</i> has been ambiguously associated with Arbuthnot since the
year of its first publication, but it does not seem to have been
reprinted e the nineteenth century when editors regularly included
it among the minor works of Swift. Whoever wrote it, the <i>Story</i> is a
lively and effective Tory squib, whose narrative vigor can carry even
the twentieth-century reader over the occasional topical obscurities. <i>A
Catalogue of the ... Library of ... Dr. Arbuthnot</i> has never been
reprinted at all, and appears to be unknown by scholars who have thus
far written about Arbuthnot.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>The Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost</i>, the first piece included, has
always been of doubtful authorship, and must for the present so
continue. Two days after the <i>Story</i> first appeared, Swift tantalizingly
wrote to Stella: "I went to Ld Mashams to night, &amp; Lady Masham made me
read to her a pretty 2 penny Pamphlet calld the St Albans Ghost. I
thought I had writt it my self; so did they, but I did not" (22 February
1712). Whoever wrote it, the <i>Story</i> succeeded: it was pirated within a
week, and had reached its third regular "edition" within three weeks of
the first; it appeared in a fifth and apparently final edition on 19
July 1712.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now just during these same months Arbuthnot was producing
his first political satires, five pamphlets later gathered under the
title <i>History of John Bull</i>. He published the first of these 4 March
1712 and the last 31 July 1712.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There are several thematic and
methodological connections between <i>The Story of The St. Alb-ns Ghost</i>
and the John Bull pamphlets: as Tory propaganda pieces, they attack
leading Whigs and make the usual suggestions about irreligion, moral
turpitude and misuse of public funds. Furthermore, they do so by means
of vigorous if sometimes difficult reductive<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span> allegories which mock the
victims by presenting them as farcical figures from low life. The
connection as well as the difficulties must have appeared quite early,
for some enterprising publisher (presumably Curll)<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> soon brought out
<i>A Complete Key to the Three Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the
Story of the St. Alban's Ghost</i>. Although the exact date of this is not
known, it must lie between the <i>termini</i> 17 April and 9 May 1712, the
dates of the third and fourth parts respectively of John Bull.
Furthermore, a "Second Edition Corrected" of the Key appeared before the
publication of pamphlet four. (The last pages of these two Keys,
concerning the <i>Story of the St. Alb-ns Ghost</i>, are reproduced in the
Appendix.) The Key ran through two further editions as <i>A Complete Key
to the Four Parts of Law is a Bottomless-Pit, and the Story of the St.
Alban's Ghost</i>, presumably before 31 July 1712, and came to a fifth
(seemingly last) edition with a more general title referring to "all
Parts" of John Bull, and still including the <i>Story</i>.</p>

<p>While the Keys by association suggest Arbuthnot as author, the only
other contemporary document attributes the <i>Story</i> to a different
physician and wit: the so-called <i>Miscellaneous Works of Dr. William
Wagstaffe</i> (London, 1726) reprint the fourth edition of the Story. Now
the <i>Miscellaneous Works</i> were printed some five months after the death
of Dr. Wagstaffe and more than three months after that of the supposed
editor Dr. Levett;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> it is possible that the contents are in part
erroneous. In any case, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and Swift remain the
possible authors with whom scholars must deal until some further
evidence is forthcoming. Roscoe interprets Swift's ambiguous remarks in
the <i>Journal to Stella</i> as an indirect acknowledgement, and Dilke goes
one step further in assuming that the so-called <i>Miscellaneous Works of
Dr. Wagstaffe</i> are a mystification, a means for Swift to pass off works
which he did not wish to include in the <i>Miscellanies</i> with Pope. Sir
Walter Scott thinks that the <i>Story</i> is probably a collaboration between
Arbuthnot and Swift, "judging from the style"; Professor Herbert Davis
dissociates Wagstaffe material generally from the writings of Swift, but
does not specifically mention the <i>Story</i>; however, "Mr. Granger thought
St. Alban's Ghost, attributed to Dr. Wagstaffe, was [Arbuthnot's]."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Although recent scholars seem to agree in selecting Wagstaffe as author
of the <i>Story</i>, the evidence of the 1726<span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span> <i>Works</i> is implicitly
contradicted by the Keys. I have made two separate attempts to solve the
question of authorship, neither of which has been fully satisfactory.
The first of these, a computerized test based on the methods of
Professor Louis T. Milic for distinguishing works by Swift from works by
other authors, has given inconclusive results. In this test the <i>Story</i>
was the chief unknown, and was compared with samples of similar length
from Swift, Arbuthnot, Wagstaffe and, as a control, Mrs. Manley, who
wrote politically keyed narratives but has never been associated with
the <i>Story</i>. The <i>Story</i> turned out to be fairly similar to all four
authors in the number of different three-word patterns (D), and unlike
all of them in number of Introductory Connectives (IC), where Wagstaffe
stood the highest, and the <i>Story</i> by far the lowest. In the proportion
of Verbals (VB) the <i>Story</i> and Wagstaffe were fairly close together and
different from the other authors tested, who clustered near the Swift
figures. Thus the test tends to exclude Swift, Arbuthnot and Mrs. Manley
as possible authors, but does not encourage a full confidence in
replacing them with Wagstaffe. (It also tends to show that some of the
other pieces included in the so-called <i>Miscellaneous Works of Dr.
Wagstaffe</i> differ considerably in the usages tested both from one
another and from the patterns established by the signed works of Dr.
Walstaffe.)<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>My second attempt was based on textual changes among editions of the
<i>Story</i>. In the second edition there are three small changes from the
first; the third and fourth editions seem to be line-for-line reprints
of the second. (The "sham, Imperfect Sort" introduces a large number of
variants, mainly errors.) In the fifth edition, however, somebody has
altered the typography: many past forms of verbs are altered. Thus at
the bottom of p. 3 <i>unbody'd</i> becomes <i>unbodyed</i>, <i>carry'd</i> and
<i>deliver'd</i> become <i>carryed</i>, <i>delivered</i>. The task of editing is not
complete; particularly near the end of the fifth edition many verbs
still carry the apostrophe of the earlier editions. The date of the
attempt suggests that Swift's <i>Proposal for Correcting, Improving and
Ascertaining the English Tongue</i> (first published 17 May 1712, a week
after the fourth edition of the <i>Story</i>) could have provided the
motivation, and also that Swift himself could not have been the person
who made the changes. A study of a few contemporaries shows that Swift
himself<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span> tried to eliminate the apostrophes from the <i>Conduct of the
Allies</i>, first published 27 November 1711, and from other works
published after that date, but not from works published before that
date. Oldisworth, apparently under the instructions of Swift, tried to
do the same during the first few months of the <i>Examiner</i>, vol. 2
(beginning 6 December 1711), but by the time he reached volume 3,
Oldisworth had apparently given up the struggle against unwilling
printers. Arbuthnot, Roper and Manley are not very interested in the
matter, and neither are other pamphleteers published by Morphew during
the months immediately following Swift's <i>Proposal</i>. The items included
in the so-called <i>Miscellaneous Works of Dr. Wagstaffe</i>, on the other
hand, fall into three groups chronologically: those which precede
Swift's <i>Proposal</i>, and include many apostrophied verb forms; those
which immediately follow Swift's <i>Proposal</i>, and include abnormally few
apostrophied verb forms; the two "late" pieces (1715, 1719), which are
back to the proportion of apostrophied verbs to be found in the early
items. If Pseudo-Wagstaffe was indeed a single writer, then he followed
the same pattern as Oldisworth, but began later and continued longer to
use verbs with an <i>-ed</i> ending. Since the genuine signed prose works of
Dr. Wagstaffe come "late" (1717, 1721) and have a fairly large (i.e.,
normal) number of apostrophied verbs, there is no evidence here as to
whether or not Pseudo-Wagstaffe is Wagstaffe; at least there is no
contradiction. In the light of these facts, we can see that neither
Swift nor Arbuthnot is a probable author of the <i>Story</i>; Swift would
presumably have altered verb typography in the first and all editions,
and Arbuthnot would not have altered it at all.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In these two projects
on authorship we find that authors other than Wagstaffe tend to be
eliminated, but that Wagstaffe himself is not strongly confirmed. The
authorship remains as problematic as before, and the <i>Story</i> may as well
for this century continue with the Arbuthnotiana, as it did during the
nineteenth with the Swiftiana.</p>

<p class="p2">The device of using a ghost story as vehicle for political satire was by
1712 a well-established one. Elias F. Mengel Jr. refers to "the 'ghost'
convention, so popular in the Restoration,"<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and an important poem of
Queen Anne's reign<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span> shows some similarities with and perhaps provided a
model for the <i>Story</i>. In <i>Moderation Display'd</i> (London, 1705) the
recently deceased second Earl of Sunderland rises from Hell to confound
his guilty Whig companions. Tonson (Bibliopolo) is the most terrified,
and as in the <i>Story</i> Wharton (Clodio) is so wicked that he is not
frightened at all. The <i>Story</i>, however, is both more subtle and more
flexible than most other satiric "ghost" narratives. It compresses the
actual apparition into the last quarter of the narrative, despite the
perhaps deliberately misleading title. Nearly half of the <i>Story</i> deals
with previous events; much of the rest is machinery, introduction of
seemingly irrelevant details with a mischievous verisimilitude which
actually advances the main satiric aims. The opening paragraph, for
example, first denounces Roman Catholic superstition, a denunciation
which almost every Englishman could join, and then turns the fire toward
"Our Sectarists." The war on heterodoxy continues in the references to
Dr. Garth, the Whig poet and physician noted for his scepticism in
religion, to William Whiston who during the winter of 1711-1712 was
transcribing documents and writing elaborate treatises to uphold his
view that Christian churches and theologians had all been essentially
heretical since the time of Athanasius, and to the Reverend and
Honourable Lumley Lloyd, a low-church minister whose sermons attracted
at least two Tory satires.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> None of these men belongs in the
narrative, and only Garth was even remotely connected with the
Marlboroughs, but all of them were Whigs, and in various ways serve to
"demonstrate" that Whigs must be false brethren to the Church of
England.</p>

<p>This charge, although a clichÃ© of Tory satires, is here made indirect
and witty, as are the staple charges against the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough. Whereas, however, the wickedness of nonconformity had been
attacked for decades, the Duke of Marlborough had been associated with
the Whigs for a relatively short time. As late as 1706 Wagstaffe could
generously declare that "<i>Woodstock's</i> too little" a reward (<i>Ramelies,
a Poem</i>), but since Swift's "Bill of British Ingratitude" in the
<i>Examiner</i> (17 November 1710) the Tory press had begun to say that the
rewards were too many and too great. The <i>Story</i> repeats the charge that
Avaro and Haggite "grew Richer than their Mistress" (p. 11), together
with the<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span> ridiculous insinuations of cowardice and incompetence found
constantly reiterated in the second volume of <i>Examiners</i>. The Duchess
of Marlborough attracted massive satire earlier than her husband, in
such books as <i>The Secret History of Queen Zarah</i> (London, 1705),<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and her habit of saying "Lawrd" with an affected drawl is mentioned in
<i>The Secret History of Arlus and Odolphus</i> (n.p., 1710), pp. 21, 22, 23.</p>

<p>Although not so frequent as attacks on the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough, attacks on Mrs. Jennings the mother of the Duchess had
already been made, and indeed the <i>Story</i> relies for part of its effect
on the fact that Mrs. Jennings is already associated with witchcraft. In
<i>Memoirs of Europe</i> (London, 1710)<a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> for example, she inherits a
familiar spirit from Sir Kenelm Digby, there reported the real father of
the Duchess (II, 44-46). In <i>Oliver's Pocket Looking-Glass</i> (n.p., 1711)
Mrs. Jennings appears as "the famous Mother Shipton, who by the Power
and Influence of her Magick Art, had plac'd a Daughter in the same
Station at Court [i.e., Maid of Honour] with <i>Meretricia</i> [Arabella
Churchill] ..." (p. 21). Because the author of the Story assumes that
previous Tory allegations are well-known, he is free to perform elegant
variations or to allude indirectly. Assuming the fact of witchcraft
allows him to heap up an ambiguous burlesque of popular superstition
which is in part entertainment and in part rebuttal of recent Whig
sneers at Tory credulity during the Jane Wenham witch trial.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Here as
throughout the pamphlet, the author demonstrates the virtuosity which
even Swift commends. Since Swift praises few pamphlets except those
written by himself and Arbuthnot (or occasionally Mrs. Manley), the
<i>Story</i> enters a fairly select company. It is the only Pseudo-Wagstaffe
piece mentioned by name in the <i>Journal to Stella</i>, the only one found
worthy to stand beside the productions of Swift and Arbuthnot.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The second document reproduced claims to be <i>A Catalogue of the Capital
and Well-Known Library of Books, of the Late Celebrated Dr. Arbuthnot</i>.
To the extent that the claim is true, the <i>Catalogue</i> will be important
for studies of the Scriblerian Club generally, since Arbuthnot is the
member with the greatest reputation for learning. Although the contents<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>
of a man's library do not correspond exactly with the contents of his
mind, scholars can discover a good deal about the intellectual methods
of Dr. Arbuthnot by examining the books which he owned. Until now this
has not been possible; the <i>Catalogue</i> is a recent acquisition of the
British Museum, not so much as mentioned in books thus far published
about Arbuthnot. For several reasons, however, the document must be used
with caution. First of all, the compilers list a total of 2525 volumes,
but they itemize only 1639,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and even then often give inadequate
information. Furthermore, a xerox copy of the Sale Book records of the
auction, very kindly sent to me by the present Messrs. Christie, Manson
and Woods, shows that almost a quarter of the lots (items 53-65,
243-245, 276-372, 426), or 999 volumes, belonged not to the Arbuthnot
estate but to other owners. Finally, Dr. Arbuthnot died in 1735, whereas
the auction was not held until December 1779, about three and a half
months after the death of his bachelor son George. Of the books
belonging to the Arbuthnot estate, almost 20% were printed after 1735,
and belonged not to the father but to the son, or perhaps in some cases
to the daughter Anne, who lived with her brother.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The legal books
are likely all to have been George Arbuthnot's, and presumably some of
the other books printed before 1735 also. Despite these obscurities, the
Catalogue throws a good deal of new light upon the most learned
Scriblerian&mdash;and upon his family.</p>

<p>Dr. Arbuthnot seems to have bought relatively few antiquarian books;
about 20% of the itemized volumes belonging to his estate come before
1691, the year when he first went to London. In selecting these older
works Arbuthnot has shown a catholic taste and linguistic ability: he
bought grammars and dictionaries, besides works on medicine and science,
literature, history and religion, written in English, French, Italian,
Latin and Greek, plus a solitary Hebrew Bible (item 234); his copy of
Udall's <i>Key to the Holy Tongue</i> is dated 1693 (item 183). Less than a
quarter of these earlier books are in English. The sole "cradle" date of
the catalogue, 1495 for <i>Rosa Anglica</i> (item 417), may be a misprint:
editions of 1492 and 1595, among others, have been previously recorded,
but none for 1495.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>When compared with the antiquarian books, the list of titles from the
Arbuthnot estate either dated or first published<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span> after the death of Dr.
Arbuthnot reveals a number of differences. English is the predominant
language of the late group, with French a poor second. There is another
Hebrew Bible (253), a Spanish Cervantes (25), an Italian Machiavelli
(96), but no Greek book at all, and astonishingly only two Latin: a
dictionary (89) and a Horace (147); Cicero appears in a French
translation (26). In part, of course, the shift in languages accompanies
the general decline of humanistic learning in the eighteenth century,
but it also strengthens our knowledge of Dr. Arbuthnot's erudition.
Although apparently not interested in science, George Arbuthnot read
widely, however, in other areas (see for example 10, 15, 49, 158, 160,
168, 170, 254, 271). Similarly, the books from outside the Arbuthnot
estate are less learned than those of Arbuthnot. They do include two
Greek testaments (290, 310) and some recent scientific works (e.g. 314,
*349), but lack the great Greek writers whom Arbuthnot collected, such
as Plato (125), Aristotle (126), Herodotus (385) or Aristophanes (387).
Whereas Arbuthnot read Newton's treatises (81, 85, 197, 217), one of the
other owners read Algarotti's simplification (*312).</p>

<p>The subjects of the books in the Arbuthnot estate can be variously
divided. By sheer number of titles, literature is the most important
subject, closely followed by science (including medicine as the biggest
sub-group), and then by history. In number of volumes, however, the
historical section is considerably larger than the literary, and science
comes third. Books on geography and travel, philosophical treatises,
grammars and dictionaries, even a work on astrology (109), attest to the
breadth of Arbuthnot's interests. A few works in the fine arts are
listed, somewhat surprisingly only two of them on music (32, 373). The
military item (391) may come from the Doctor's brother George, who was
in the army, or it may represent another aspect of the general interest
in all human affairs. There is a fairly large number of religious works,
including books by Eusebius and Sozomen (127), Spotswood (380), Huet
(383), Charles Leslie (251), Leibniz (141), Tillotson (395) and Jeremy
Taylor (3,394). The elaborately bound Greek Septuagint (272) and Greek
New Testament (273) must be the ones which Arbuthnot specified in his
will (the only books there mentioned), calling them "the Gift of my late
Royal Mistress Queen Anne."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As the <i>Catalogue</i> does not describe<span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>
any other fine bindings, the other books seem to have been bought for
use rather than for show.</p>

<p>A study of the duplications among the books in the Arbuthnot estate
reinforces the opinion that the books were bought for use. The only
items appearing three times are the works of Pope (76, 180) and Pope's
<i>Iliad</i> (11, 77, 242). Since two of the former were published after the
death of Arbuthnot, and must have belonged to the Arbuthnot children,
perhaps the extra <i>Iliads</i> were equally the property of Arbuthnot's
heirs. The duplicates of MoliÃ¨re (21, 135), Prideaux (50, 379), and
Veneroni (90, *229) could also have belonged to the children. However,
the bulk of the duplications seem to involve obtaining a later edition
or a necessary text, and thus to have a scholarly rationale. For
example, the two editions of Eustachius are dated 1714, 1728 (115, 259),
those of Livy are dated 1578, 1708 (7, 386), while both sets of
Sennertus seem to be broken (406, 407).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Arbuthnot owned a number of satirical works. In
addition to Pope and MoliÃ¨re, already mentioned, he owned Petronius (9),
Juvenal and Persius (230), Terence (231), Plautus (232), Boileau (98),
Gay (79) and Swift's <i>Tale of a Tub</i> (178). He presumably bought or was
given other works by Swift, but no others are itemized; perhaps some
were in the "Large parcel of pamphlets" (1). George Arbuthnot added a
copy of <i>The Four Last Years of Queen Anne</i> (173), not published until
1758.</p>

<p>Although literature bulks large among Arbuthnot's books, English poetry
is not very conspicuous. According to some of the dates, Arbuthnot may
have developed his interest in English poetry rather late in life.
Although he owned a 1611 Spenser (423), he did not buy the listed
Chaucer (110) until 1721. Pope may have inspired the urge to acquire
Milton (80, 185), but there seems to be no literary reason for wanting a
Milton in French (184). Some other member of the family was, however,
sufficiently interested in Milton to buy Newton's edition in 1749 (78).
The minor poets listed are also late in date (72, 187). The only Dryden
is the translation of Virgil (16), which could represent an interest in
classical just as much as in English poetry. There are, however, two
copies of Prior's <i>Poems</i> in the large paper edition (106, 252). As the
compilers of<span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span> the <i>Catalogue</i> have left many volumes unspecified, there
must have been other poetic works, but the listed sample is rather
small.</p>

<p>Characteristically uninterested in his personal fame, Arbuthnot kept no
copies of his own writings except the reissued <i>Tables of Ancient Coins</i>
(84, 193), associated with a favorite son. The reader revealed by this
library is the same Arbuthnot whom his contemporaries admired: witty,
yet thoughtful and religious; deeply learned, yet modest. His children,
although less learned than the father, continued to buy books on current
topics, particularly literature, history and travel. Aged over seventy,
George Arbuthnot was still ingesting such materials as Laughton's
<i>History of Ancient Egypt</i> (168) and Raynal's comprehensive history of
colonialism (10). Despite the obscurity of the word "more" under which
the compilers listed half of the total volumes, even the sample of the
library is a welcome addition to our knowledge about Dr. Arbuthnot.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE ST. ALB-NS GHOST.</h2>

<p>I can scarcely say whether we ought to attribute the Multitude of Ghosts
and Apparitions, which were so common in the Days of our Forefathers, to
the Ignorance of the People, or the Impositions of the Priest. The
Romish Clergy found it undoubtedly for their Interest to deceive them,
and the Superstition of the People laid themselves open to receive
whatsoever They thought proper to inculcate. Hence it is, that their
Traditions are little else, than the Miracles and Atchievements of
unbody'd Heroes, a Sort of spiritual Romance, so artfully carry'd on,
and delivered<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span> in so probable a Manner, as may easily pass for Truth on
those of an uncultivated Capacity, or a credulous Disposition. Our
Sectarists indeed still retain the Credulity, as well as some of the
Tenets of that Church; and Apparitions, and such like, are still the
Bug-bears made use of by some of the most Celebrated of their
Holders-forth to terrify the old Women of their Congregation, (who are
their surest Customers) and enlarge their Quarterly Subscriptions. I
know one of these Ambidexters, who never fails of Ten or Twenty Pounds
more than Ordinary, by nicking <i>something Wonderful</i> in due Time; he
often cloaths his whole Family <i>by the Apparition of a Person lately
executed at</i> Tyburn; or, <i>a Whale seen at</i> Greenwich, <i>or thereabouts</i>;
and I am credibly inform'd, that his Wife has made a Visit with a Brand
new Sable Tippet on, since the Death of the <i>Tower Lions</i>.</p>

<p>But as these Things will pass upon none but the Ignorant or
Superstitious, so there are others that will believe nothing of this
Nature, even upon the clearest Evidence. There are, it must be own'd,
but very few of these Accounts to be depended on; some however are so
palpable, and testify'd by so good Authority, by those of such undoubted
Credit, and so discerning a Curiosity, that there is no Room to doubt of
their Veracity, and which none but a Sceptic can disbelieve. Such is the
following Story of Mother <i>Haggy</i> of St. <i>Alb&mdash;&mdash;ns</i>, in the Reign of
King <i>James</i> the First, the mighty Pranks she plaid in her Life-time,
and her Apparition afterwards, made such a Noise, both at Home and
Abroad, and were so terri<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>ble to the Neighbourhood, that the Country
People, to this Day, cannot hear the Mention of her Name, without the
most dismal Apprehensions. The Injuries they receiv'd from the Sorceries
and Incantations of the Mother, and the Injustice and Oppression of the
Son and Daughter, have made so deep an Impression upon their Minds, and
begot such an Hereditary Aversion to their Memory, that they never speak
of them, without the bitterest Curses and Imprecations.</p>

<p>I have made it my Business, being at St. <i>Alb&mdash;&mdash;ns</i> lately, to enquire
more particularly into this Matter, and the Helps I have receiv'd from
the <i>most noted Men of Erudition in this City, have been Considerable</i>,
and to whom I make my publick Acknowledgment. The Charges I have been at
in <i>getting Manuscripts</i>, and Labour in <i>collating them</i>, the
Reconciling the Disputes about the most <i>material Circumstances</i>, and
adjusting the <i>various Readings</i>, as they have took me up a considerable
Time, so I hope they may be done to the Satisfaction of my Reader. I
wish I could have had Time to have distinguish'd by an Asterism the
Circumstances deliver'd by Tradition only, from those of the
Manuscripts, which I was advis'd to do by my worthy Friend the Reverend
Mr. <i>Wh&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, who, had he not been <i>Employ'd otherways</i>, might have
been a very proper Person to have undertaken such a Performance.</p>

<p>The best Manuscripts are now in the Hands of the Ingenious Dr.
<i>G&mdash;&mdash;th</i>, where they are left for the Curious to peruse, and where any
<i>Clergyman</i> may be welcome; for however he<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span> may have been abus'd by
those who deny him to be the Author of the <i>D&mdash;&mdash;y</i>, and tax'd by others
with Principles and Practices unbecoming a Man of his Sense and Probity,
yet I will be bold to say in his Defence, that I believe he is as good a
Christian, as he is a Poet, and if he publishes any Thing on the late
D&mdash;&mdash;d <i>M&mdash;&mdash;y</i>, I don't question but it will be interspers'd with as
many Precepts of Reveal'd Religion, as the Subject is capable of
bearing: And it is very probable, those <i>Refin'd Pieces</i> that the Doctor
has been pleas'd to own, since the Writing of the <i>D&mdash;&mdash;y</i>, have been
look'd upon, by the lewd debauch'd Criticks of the Town, to be dull and
insipid, for no other Reason, but because they are grave and sober; but
this I leave for others to determine, and can say for his Sincerity,
that I am assur'd he believes the following Relation as much as any of
us all.</p>

<p>Mother <i>Haggy</i> was marry'd to a plain home-spun Yeoman of St.
<i>Alb&mdash;&mdash;ns</i>, and liv'd in good Repute for some Years: The Place of her
Birth is disputed by some of the most celebrated Moderns, tho' they have
a Tradition in the Country, that she was never Born at all, and which is
most probable. At the Birth of her Daughter <i>Haggite</i>, something
happen'd very remarkable, and which gave Occasion to the Neighbourhood
to mistrust she had a Correspondence with <i>Old Nick</i>, as was confirm'd
afterwards, beyond the Possibility of Disproof. The Neighbours were got
together a Merry-making, as they term it, in the Country, when the old
Woman's High-crown'd Hat, that had been thrown upon the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span> Bed's Tester
during the Heat of the Engagement, leap'd with a wonderful Agility into
the Cradle, and being catch'd at by the Nurse, was metamorphos'd into a
Coronet, which according to her Description, was not much unlike that of
a <i>German</i> Prince; but it soon broke into a thousand Pieces. <i>Such</i>,
cries old Mother <i>Haggy, will be the Fortune of my Daughter, and such
her Fall</i>. The Company took but little Notice what she said, being
surpris'd at the Circumstance of the Hat. <i>But this is Fact</i>, says the
Reverend and Honourable L&mdash;&mdash;y <i>L&mdash;&mdash;d</i>, <i>and my Grandmother, who was a
Person of Condition, told me</i>, says He, <i>she knew the Man, who knew the
Woman, who was</i>, said she, <i>in the Room at that Instant</i>. The very same
Night, I saw a Comet, neither have I any Occasion to tell a Lye as to
this Particular, <i>says my Author</i>, brandishing its Tail in a very
surprising Manner in the Air, but upon the Breaking of a Cloud, I could
discern, <i>continues he</i>, a Clergyman at the Head of a Body of his own
Cloth, and follow'd by an innumerable Train of Laity, who coming towards
the Comet, it disappear'd.</p>

<p>This was the first Time Mother <i>Haggy</i> became suspected, and it was the
Opinion of the Wisest of the Parish, that they should Petition the King
to send her to be try'd for a Witch by the <i>Presbytery of Scotland</i>. How
this past off I cannot tell, but certain it is, that some of the Great
Ones of the Town were in with her, and 'tis said she was Serviceable to
them in their Amours: She had a Wash that would make the Skin of a
Blackamore as white as Alabaster, and another, that would restore the
Loss of a Maidenhead, <i>without any Hindrance of Business, or the
Know<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>ledge of any one about them</i>. She try'd this Experiment so often
upon her Daughter <i>Haggite</i>, that more than Twenty were satisfy'd they
had her Virginity before Marriage.</p>

<p>She soon got such a Reputation all about the Country, that there was not
a Cow, a Smock, or a silver Spoon lost, but they came to her to enquire
after it; All the young People flock'd to have their Fortunes told,
which, they say she never miss'd. She told <i>Haggite</i>'s Husband, he
should grow Rich, and be a Great Man, but by his Covetousness and
Griping of the Poor, should come to an ill End. All which happen'd so
exactly, <i>That there are several old Folks in our Town, who can remember
it, as if it was but Yesterday</i>.</p>

<p>She has been often seen to ride full gallop upon a Broom-Stick at
Noon-Day, and swim over a River in a Kettle-Drum. Sometimes she wou'd
appear in the Shape of a Lioness, and at other times of a Hen, or a Cat;
but I have heard, could not turn herself into a Male Creature, or walk
over two Straws across. There were never known so many great Winds as
about that Time, or so much Mischief done by them: The Pigs gruntled,
and the Screech-Owls hooted oftner than usual; a Horse was found dead
one Morning with Hay in his Mouth; and a large overgrown Jack was caught
in a Fish-Pond thereabouts with a silver Tobacco-Box in his Belly;
several Women were brought to Bed of two Children, Some miscarry'd, and
old Folks died very frequently.</p>

<p>These Things could not chuse but breed a great Combustion in the Town,
as they call it, and every Body certainly had rejoyc'd at her<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span> Death,
had she not been succeeded by a Son and Daughter, who, tho' they were no
Conjurers, were altogether as terrible to the Neighbourhood. She had two
Daughters, one of which was marry'd to a Man who went beyond Sea; the
other, her Daughter <i>Haggite</i>, to <i>Avaro</i>, whom we shall have Occasion
to mention in the Sequel of this Story.</p>

<p>There liv'd at that Time in the Neighbourhood two Brothers, of a great
Family, Persons of a vast Estate and Character, and extreamly kind to
their Servants and Dependants. <i>Haggite</i> by her Mother's Interest, was
got into this Family, and <i>Avaro</i>, who was afterwards her Husband, was
the Huntsman's Boy. He was a Lad of a fine Complexion, good Features,
and agreeable to the fair Sex, but wanted the Capacity of some of his
fellow Servants: Tho' he got a Reputation afterwards for a Man of
Courage, but upon no other Grounds, than by setting the Country Fellows
to Cudgelling or Boxing, and being a Spectator of a broken Head and a
bloody Nose.</p>

<p>There are several authentic Accounts of the Behaviour of these Two, in
their respective Stations, and by what Means they made an Advancement of
their Fortunes. There are several Relations, I say, now extant, that
tell us, how one of these great Brothers took <i>Avaro</i>'s Sister for his
Mistress, which was the Foundation of his Preferment, and how <i>Haggite</i>,
by granting her Favours to any one who would go to the Expence of them,
became extreamly Wealthy, and how Both had gain'd the Art of getting
Money out of every Body they had to do with, and by the most
dishonourable Me<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>thods. Never perhaps, was any Couple so match'd in
every Thing as these, or so fit for one another: A Couple so link'd by
the Bonds of Iniquity, as well as Marriage, that it is impossible to
tell which had the greatest Crimes to answer for.</p>

<p>It will be needless to relate the Fortune of the Brothers, who were
their Successive Masters, and the Favours they bestow'd on them. It is
sufficient that the Estate came at last to a Daughter of the younger
Brother, a Lady, who was the Admiration of the Age she liv'd in, and the
Darling of the whole Country, and who had been attended from her Infancy
by <i>Haggite</i>.</p>

<p>Then it was <i>Avaro</i> began his Tyranny; he was entrusted with all the
Affairs of Consequence, and there was nothing done without his
Knowledge. He marry'd his Daughters to some of the most considerable
Estates in the Neighbourhood, and was related by Marriage to one
<i>Baconface</i>, a sort of Bailiff to his Lady. He, and <i>Baconface</i> and
<i>Haggite</i> got into Possession, as it were, of their Lady's Estate, and
carry'd it with so high a Hand, were so haughty to the Rich, and
oppressive to the Poor, that they quickly began to make themselves
odious; but for their better Security, they form'd a sort of Confederacy
with one <i>Dammyblood</i>, <i>Clumzy</i> their Son-in-Law, <i>Splitcause</i> an
Attorney, and <i>Mouse</i> a noted Ballad-Maker, and some others. As soon as
they had done this, they began so to domineer, that there was no Living
for those who would not compliment, or comply with them in their
Villany. <i>Haggite</i> cry'd, <i>Lord, Madam</i>, to her Mistress, <i>It must be
so</i>; <i>Avaro</i> swore,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span> <i>By</i> G&mdash;&mdash;d, and <i>Baconface</i> shook his Head, and
look'd dismally. They made every Tenant pay a Tax, and every Servant
considerably out of his Wages toward the Mounding their Lady's Estate,
as they pretended, but most part of it went into their own Pockets. Once
upon a Time, the Tenants grumbling at their Proceedings, <i>Clumzy</i>, the
Son-in-Law, brought in a Parcel of Beggars to settle upon the Estate.
Thus they liv'd for some Years, till they grew Richer than their
Mistress, and were, perhaps, the Richest Servants in the World: Nay,
what is the most Remarkable, and will scarcely find Belief in future
Ages, they began at last to deny her Title to the Estate, and affirm,
she held it only by their Permission and Connivance.</p>

<p>Things were come to this pass, when one of the Tenants Sons from
<i>Oxf&mdash;&mdash;rd</i> preach'd up Obedience to their Lady, and the Necessity of
their Downfall, who oppos'd it. This open'd the Eyes of all the honest
Tenants, but enrag'd <i>Avaro</i> and his Party, to that Degree, that they
had hir'd a Pack of Manag'd Bull-Dogs, with a Design to bait him, and
had done it infallibly, had not the Gentry interpos'd, and the Country
People run into his Assistance. These, with much ado, muzled the Dogs,
and petition'd their Lady to discard the Mismanagers, who consented to
it.</p>

<p>Great were the Endeavours, and great the Struggles of the Faction, for
so they were call'd, to keep themselves in Power, as the Histories of
those Times mention. They stirr'd up all their Ladies Acquaintance to
speak to her in their behalf, wrote Letters to and fro, swore<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span> and
curs'd, laugh'd and cry'd, told the most abominable and inconsistent
Lyes, but all to no Purpose: They spent their Money, lavish'd away their
Beef, Pudding, and <i>October</i>, most unmercifully, and made several
<i>Jointed-Babies</i> to shew for Sights, and please the Tenants Sons about
<i>Christmas</i>.</p>

<p>Old <i>Drybones</i> was then the Parson of the Parish, a Man of the most
notorious Character, who would change his Principles at any Time to
serve a Turn, preach or pray <i>Extempore</i>, talk Nonsense, or any Thing
else, for the Advancement of <i>Avaro</i> and his Faction. He was look'd upon
to be the greatest Artist in <i>Legerdemain</i> in that Country; and had a
Way of shewing the Pope and little Master in a Box, but the Figures were
so very small, it was impossible for any Body but himself to discern
them. He was hir'd, as is suppos'd, to tax the New Servants with Popery,
together with their Mistress, which he preach'd in several Churches
thereabouts; but his Character was too well known to make any Thing
credited that came from him.</p>

<p>There are several Particulars related, both by Tradition and the
Manuscripts, concerning the turning out of these Servants, which would
require greater Volumes than I design. It is enough, that
notwithstanding their Endeavours, they were Discarded, and the Lady
chose her new Servants out of the most honest and substantial of her
Tenants, of undoubted Abilities, who were tied to her by Inclination as
well as Duty. These began a Reformation of all the Abuses committed by
<i>Avaro</i> and <i>Baconface</i>, which discover'd such a Scene of Roguery<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span> to
the World, that one would hardly think the most mercenary Favourites
could be guilty of.</p>

<p><i>Avaro</i> now began to be very uneasie, and to be affrighted at his own
Conscience; he found nothing would pacifie the enrag'd Tenants, and that
his Life wou'd be but a sufficient Recompence for his Crimes. His Money
which he rely'd on, and which he lavish'd away to Bribe off his
Destruction, had not Force enough to Protect him: He could not, as it is
reported, Sit still in one Place for two Minutes, never Slept at all,
Eat little or nothing, Talk'd very rambling and inconsistent, of
<i>Merit</i>, <i>Hardships</i>, <i>Accounts</i>, <i>Perquisites</i>, <i>Commissioners</i>,
<i>Bread</i> and <i>Bread-Waggons</i>, but was never heard to mention any
<i>Cheese</i>.</p>

<p>He came and made a Confession in his own House to some People he never
saw before in his Life, and which shews no little Disorder in his Brain;
<i>That, whatever they might think of him, he was as Dutiful a Servant as
any his Mistress had</i>. <i>Haggite</i> rav'd almost as bad as he, and had got
St. <i>Anthony's Fire</i> in her Face; but it is a question, says Dr.
<i>G&mdash;th</i>, whether there was any Thing Ominous in that, since it is
probable, the Distemper only chang'd it's Situation.</p>

<p>Mean while, it was agreed by <i>Baconface</i> and others, that a Consultation
should be call'd at <i>Avaro</i>'s House, something Decisive resolv'd on, in
order to prevent their Ruin; and accordingly <i>Jacobo</i> the Messenger was
sent to inform the Cabal of it.</p>

<p>Dismal and horrid was the Night of that infernal Consultation, nothing
heard but the me<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>lancholly Murmuring of Winds, and the Croaking of Toads
and Ravens; Every thing seem'd Wild and Desert, and double Darkness
overspread the Hemisphere: Thunder and Lightning, Storms and Tempest,
and Earthquakes, seem'd to Presage something more then Ordinary, and
added to the Confusion of that Memorable Night. Nature sicken'd, and
groan'd, as it were, under the Tortures of universal Ruine. Not a
Servant in the House but had Dreamt the strangest Dreams, and <i>Haggite</i>
her self had seen a Stranger in the Candle. The Fire languish'd and
burnt Blue, and the Crickets sung continually about the Oven: How far
the Story is true concerning the Warming-Pan and Dishes, I cannot say,
but certain it is, a Noise was heard like that of rolling Pease from the
top of the House to the bottom; and the Windows creak'd, and the Doors
rattled in a manner not a little terrible. Several of their Servants
made Affidavit, That <i>Haggite</i> lost a red Petticoat, a Ruff, and a Pair
of Green-Stockings, that were her Mother's, but the Night before, and a
Diamond-Cross once gave her by a <i>Great Man</i>.</p>

<p>'Twas about Midnight before this Black Society got together, and no
sooner were they seated, when <i>Avaro</i> open'd to them in this manner. We
have try'd, <i>says he</i>, my Friends, all the Artifices we cou'd invent or
execute, but all in vain. Our Mistress has discover'd plainly our
Intentions, and the Tenants will be neither flatter'd, nor frighted, nor
brib'd into our Interest. It remains therefore, and what tho' we Perish
in the Attempt, we must Perish otherwise, that once for all we make a
Push at the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span> very Life of&mdash;&mdash;When, Lo! <i>says the Manuscript</i>, An unusual
Noise interrupted his Discourse, and <i>Jacobo</i> cry'd out, <i>The Devil, the
Devil at the Door</i>. Scarce had he Time to speak, or they to listen, when
the Apparition of Mother <i>Haggy</i> entred; But, Who can describe the
Astonishment they were then in? <i>Haggite</i> sounded away in the
Elbow-Chair as she sat, and <i>Avaro</i>, notwithstanding his boasted
Courage, slunk under the Table in an Instant: <i>Baconface</i> screw'd
himself into a thousand Postures; and <i>Clumzy</i> trembled till his very
Water trickled from him. <i>Splitcause</i> tumbled over a Joint-Stool, and
<i>Mouse</i> the Ballad-Maker broke a Brandy-Bottle that had been <i>Haggite</i>'s
Companion for some Years: But <i>Dammyblood, Dammyblood</i> only was the Man
that had the Courage to cry out G-d D-m your Bl&mdash;d, What occasion for
all this Bustle? Is it not the Devil, and is he not our old
Acquaintance? This reviv'd them in some Measure; but the Ghastlyness of
the Spectacle made still some Impression on them. There was an
unaccountable Irregularity in her Dress, a Wanness in her Complexion,
and a Disproportion in her Features. Flames of Fire issued from her
Nostrils, and a sulphurous Smoak from her Mouth, which together with the
Condition some of the Company were in, made a very noisome and offensive
Smell; and <i>I have been told</i>, says a very Grave Alderman of <i>St.
Albans, Some of them saw her Cloven Foot</i>.</p>

<p>I Come, <i>says she</i>, at length, (in an hollow Voice, more terrible than
the celebrated Stentor, or the brawny <i>Caledonian</i>) I Come, O ye
Accomplices in Iniquity, to tell you of your Crimes, to bid you desist
from these Cabals, for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span> they are Fruitless, and prepare for Punishment
that is Certain. I have, as long as I could, assisted you in your
Glorious Execrable Attempts, but Time is now no more; the Time is coming
when you must be deliver'd up to Justice. As to you, O Son and Daughter,
<i>said she</i>, turning to them, 'tis but a few revolving Moons, e'er you
must both fall a Sacrifice to your Avarice and Ambition, as I have told
you heretofore, but your Mistress will be too Merciful, and tho' your
ready Money must be refunded, your Estate in Land will Descend onto your
Heirs. But you, O <i>Baconface</i>, you have Merited nothing to save either
your Life or your Estate, be contented therefore with the Loss of both:
And <i>Clumzy, says she</i>, you must have the same Fate, your Insolence to
your Lady, and the Beggars you brought in upon the Tenants will require
it. <i>Dammyblood, continues she</i>, turning towards him, you must expect a
considerable Fine; but <i>Splitcause</i> and <i>Mouse</i> may come off more
easily. She said, gave a Shriek; and disappear'd; and the Cabal
dispers'd with the utmost Consternation.</p>
